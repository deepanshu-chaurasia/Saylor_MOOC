Question 6b 

NuMetro has a special offer on movies for all members of the public but special discounts for students and pensioners.  
If pensioners or students buy a movie ticket, they receive 10% if they buy a movie and popcorns, they receive 20% discount.  
100 Other customers only receive a discount when they buy a movie ticket and popcorn; there is no discount for just a movie ticket alone.  


Write a program named question6b.cpp that will consist of two functions. The program must prompt the user for type of customer (‘p’ for pensioner, ‘s’ for student, ‘o’ for other). 
It must then call the relevant function according to that entry. 

The first function must receive the customer type and calculates discount for pensioners and students.  

The second function calculates the discount for customers that are not pensioners or students.
