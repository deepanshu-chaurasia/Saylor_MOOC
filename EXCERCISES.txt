--- Exercises ---
 
Exercise 1:

Write a program that performs arithmetic division.  

The program will use two integers, a and b (obtained by the user) and will perform the division a/b, 
store the result in another integer c and show the result of the division using cout.  

In a similar way, extend the program to add, subtract, multiply, do modulo and power using integers a and b.  

Modify your program so that when it starts, it asks the user which type of calculation it should do, 
then asks for the 2 integers, then runs the user selected calculation and outputs the result in a user-friendly formatted manner. 


Exercise 2:

Basically, the same as exercise 1, but this time, the function that adds the numbers should be void, 
and takes a third, pass by reference parameter; then puts the sum in that. 
 
 
Exercise 3:

Write a recursive function that finds the #n integer of the Fibonacci sequence. 
Then build a minimal program to test it. For reference see Wikipedia:Fibonacci number(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number). 

For any possible natural number "n", the following applies  

fib(n+2) = fib(n+1) + fib(n). Also, the following are predefined fib(0) = 0 fib(1)=1 

 
Exercise 4:

Basically, the same as exercise 3, although this time you mustn't use recursion. 
For extra exercise, give a big number (like 1000000) to both exercise 3 and 4 solutions and compare the execution times. 
Ponder on the results.


Exercise 5:

Create a calculator that takes a number, a basic math operator (+, -, *, /, ^), and a second number all from user input, 
and have it print the result of the mathematical operation. 
The mathematical operations should be wrapped inside of functions.
